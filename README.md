This project investigates the potential of machine learning to predict credit card customer attrition (churn). Publicly available data on customer demographics and credit card activity was analyzed to identify key factors influencing churn behavior. These factors, including average transaction amount and credit limit, were then leveraged to build machine learning models capable of predicting customers at risk of closing their accounts. While limitations exist in the data, such as the absence of details on card type and issuing institution, this project successfully demonstrates the potential for machine learning to revolutionize customer retention strategies within the financial services industry. Future work will focus on incorporating more specific data points and navigating ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and responsible marketing practices to ensure successful model deployment and implementation.
